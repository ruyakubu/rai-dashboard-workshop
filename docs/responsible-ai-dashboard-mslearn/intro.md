# Responsible AI Dashboard workshop 
This workshop gives you a hands on experience on how to use an the Responsible AI dashboard from Azure Machine Learn to a trained classification model for diabetes hospital readmission. The lab will walk you through the steps of training a model, deploying it and then use the dashboard to debug and assess the model for fairness, inclusiveness, transparency, accountability and reliability concerns.


## Use Case Overview
We will be using a Diabetes Hospital Readmission dataset to train a classification model that predicts whether a diabetic patient will be Readmitted or Not Readmitted back in a hospital < 30 days after being discharged. 

## Data
Weâ€™ll be using the [UCI's Diabetes 130-US hospitals for years 1999â€“2008](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetes+130-US+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008#) dataset

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Machine Learning concepts
- If you're new to machine learning, we recommend you take the [ML for Beginners](https://github.com/microsoft/ML-For-Beginners) before you start this workshop.
- You do not need an Azure subscription to complete this hands-on workshop. MS Learn sandbox environment will provide Azure resources you need to complete this workshop.


# Objectives
- Work with an interactive UI dashboard to debug and mitigate model issues faster
- Produce AI systems that are more reliable and trustworthy
- Provide AI model explanability for compliance regulations or auditors better
- Helpful for decision-makers and stakeholders to be able to understand and make well informed decisions based on the model's outcomes and behavior

# Duration
Let's uncover the benefits of using Azure Machine Learning's Responsible AI dashboard in 1 hour.
