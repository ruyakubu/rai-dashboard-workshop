AI innovations are growth at a rapid pace.  The the way we design AI systems is poised to transform businesses and society. However, AI systems developed without careful consideration can have unintended harmful consequences. As a result, societal expectations are growing: more members of society are considering whether AI is trustworthy and what companies are innovating with their concerns in mind.  Government are starting to step in to regulate AI in response.

[Responsible AI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/responsible-ai) is a framework that helps AI developers to identify and mitigate risks and harms that could impact people, businesses, and society. This provides practices that are necessary to help AI developers address compliance regulations and harms that could impact threat to human rights; risk of physical or psychological injury; or life opportunities.
