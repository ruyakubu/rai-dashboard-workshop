The original UCI dataset is large with ~101,700 records. So, we reduced the data sample size and used the SMOTE technique to balance out the minority class during the data cleansing process for our training. We dropped the columns that had a huge number of missing values or were not relevant to a diabetic patient returning back to the hospital within 30 days. For example, having 20+ columns of whether or not a patient took a certain diabetic medication (",(0,o.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},"rosiglitazon"),", ",(0,o.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},"citoglipton"),", ",(0,o.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},"metformin")," etc.) had no correlation on a patient's return to the hospital. A patient's ",(0,o.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},"Weight")," has impact on a patients return, however more than 30% of the data had missing values. The patient's form of payment does not have impact on the return to the hospital, so we dropped the ",(0,o.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},"Payer_Code"),". However, we added the ",(0,o.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},"Medicare")," and ",(0,o.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},"Medicaid")," column to indicate whether or not the Payer_Code for the hospital bill used a subsidize government medical assistance for low-income patients.
